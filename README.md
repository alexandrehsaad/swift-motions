# swift-motions

A wrapper on the CoreMotion framework replacing the completion blocks with Swift concurrency.

## Installation

1. Add the package to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file.

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/alexandrehsaad/swift-motions.git", branch: "main")
    ],
    ...
)
```

2. Add the package as a dependency on your target in your `Package.swift` file.

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
            .product(name: "Motions", package: "swift-motions")
        ]),
    ],
    ...
)
```

3. Import the package in your source code.

```swift
import Motions
```

## Demonstration

4. Initiate the manager once.

```swift
let manager: MotionManager = .shared
```

5. Requests the userâ€™s permission to use location services and do something with the asynchronous value you receive. You can not show twice to the user an authorization dialog, but you can show the steps to change the permission from Settings.

```swift
do {
    let status: AuthorizationStatus = try await manager.requestAuthorization()
    // Do something with the status.
    print(status)
} catch let error {
    // Do something with the error.
    print(error)
}
```

6. Subscribe to a meter and do something with the asynchronous stream of values you receive. The return type from the accelerometers is `Acceleration`, the gyrometers is `RotationRate` and the magnetometers is `MagneticField`. All three data types conform to `PlottableInThreeDimensions`.

```swift
do {
    let stream: AsyncStream<Acceleration> = try manager.subscribeToAccelerometer()
    for await data in stream {
        // Do something with the data.
        print(data)
    }
} catch let error {
    // Do something with the error.
    print(error)
}
```

7. Unsubscribe from the sensor.

```swift
manager.unsubscribeFromAccelerometer()
```

## Troubleshooting

Your app must include usage description keys in its `Info.plist` file for the types of data it needs. Failure to include these keys cause the app to crash. To access motion data specifically, it must include `NSMotionUsageDescription`.

## Roadmap

You can use this framework to access raw data from the user's accelerometers, gyrometers and magnetometers. It could be extended to support a processed version of that data.
